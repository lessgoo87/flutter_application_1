*Our Bio Generator follows a simple and structured workflow:

User Input: The user enters their name, mood, profession, and platform in the Flutter app.
API Request: The Flutter frontend sends a request to the Flask backend.
Bio Generation: The backend processes the request and returns a dynamically generated bio.
Display Output: The generated bio is displayed on the Flutter app interface.
